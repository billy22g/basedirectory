== README

BaseDirectory.com is a web application providing military base information for every base around the world. 

I am currently learning Rails in gSchool, so I'm using the base directory model to reinforce the skills I learn.

The database is currently sqlite3, and I'm using Ruby 2.0.0. My intent is to continue developing this as I pick up new skills. 

To deploy this app, you'll just need to use "rails s" in your terminal, and go to localhost:3000.

Thanks!
